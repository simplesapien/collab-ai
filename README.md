# Collab AI - Multi-Agent Collaborative AI System

## Overview
Collab AI is a multi-agent system designed to facilitate problem-solving through coordinated AI agents. The system orchestrates specialized agents in structured discussions, generating actionable insights through iterative collaboration.

üí° **Active Development**: This project is continuously evolving. Contributions are welcome to enhance its capabilities and refine core components. It's a functional mess right now but I see some potential and I've had a lot of fun building it so far. 

## üéØ Key Features

### Multi-Agent System
- **Director**: Orchestrates discussions and manages agent coordination
- **Analyst**: Provides data-driven insights and detailed analysis
- **Critic**: Evaluates proposals and identifies potential issues
- **Expert**: Contributes domain-specific knowledge and solutions

### Core Capabilities
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Iterative, multi-round discussions for comprehensive analysis
- **Quality Control**: Automated validation ensures coherent and relevant responses
- **Real-time Updates**: Live interaction during agent collaboration
- **Cost Management**: API token usage tracking and optimization
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive system activity monitoring
