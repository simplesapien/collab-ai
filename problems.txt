Current Flow:
User Query -> Director Assigns -> Agents Respond -> Basic Discussion

Proposed Flow:
User Query -> 
    1. Context Building Phase (shared knowledge construction)
    2. Analysis Phase (specialized insights)
    3. Synthesis Phase (integration of insights)
    4. Action Phase (concrete recommendations)


    Key Issues in Current System:

Conversational Pattern


Agents are essentially taking turns speaking, rather than building on each other's insights
The discussion lacks a clear progression toward actionable conclusions
Too much overlap in agent contributions, diluting their specialized roles


Knowledge Flow


Information isn't effectively accumulating between agent interactions
Each agent seems to start fresh rather than building on previous insights
The system isn't learning or adapting during the conversation


Value Generation


Multiple agents repeating similar high-level advice
Not enough specificity or depth as the conversation progresses
Missing concrete, actionable next steps

Recommended Strategic Changes:

Shift from "Round-Robin" to "Progressive Insight" Model


Instead of agents taking turns, structure the conversation as progressive layers of insight
Each agent should explicitly build upon and refine previous contributions
Move from general to specific as the conversation progresses


Implement Clear Cognitive Division


Market Research → identifies specific opportunities and validates them
Business Model → develops concrete monetization strategies for validated opportunities
Entrepreneur → creates specific action plans and implementation steps
Director → synthesizes and ensures progression


Create Knowledge Accumulation Pattern


Each agent interaction should produce specific deliverables for the next agent
Information should become more refined and actionable at each step
Final output should be concrete and immediately actionable


Introduce Stage-Based Progression:

CopySTAGE 1: Market Understanding
↓
STAGE 2: Strategy Development
↓
STAGE 3: Implementation Planning
↓
STAGE 4: Action Steps & Timeline
This creates a natural flow where each stage has clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria.
