# ORGANIZE ME 

* Refine what makes an insight an insight.   
* Look into making sure similar insights aren’t stored.   
* The parseAndAnalyze method is going to get pretty huge, maybe look into some ways we can break that up a bit?   
* There isn’t enough context from previous discussions/the user’s request making it through all of the director’s methods (i.e. wanting to start something in vancouver)  
* Still want to make sure there is ample separation between conversation manager and insight manager so the conversation manager’s duties are quite siloed  
* Look into LLM limit that was set in the LLMService file 

Next:  
Quality, coordination, notification left to go through to clean up logs a bit.  
(1 hr)

* Update the performance logs to include more identifiable data  
  * Check first if the director one is working well  
* Update logs in messageFormatter  
* 

(30 min)

* ADJUST THE phases so that they all use the execute with login properly and pass whatever their important data is to that second parameter, and have it parsed correctly by the basePhase method

(30 min)

Start implementing some quality/validation checks?

New problems arising:

* Director plans are too action focused, these agents can’t really do anything yet.  
* Look briefly into why the analyst doesn’t seem to be getting selected as often. (only seems to be in the collaboration phase)  
* The first time the agent’s are being given their initial tasks, they are given the context of the other agents’ tasks as well    
* do i have getModelForAgent set up in two different places? isn’t really even necessary anymore  
* Why is the system constructor split into an init function   
  * Are any of those functions in system even being run?

**Phase 1: Quality Control Enhancement**

**Potential agents:**

* Copywriter  
* Research assistant  
* 

**Next tasks in order of flow** 

1. Prompt adjustments  
   1. “Be specific, not general”  
   2. Get the agents to focus on having true shorter back-and-forth dialogues.   
   3. Get agents to truly build on previous points  
   4. Roles (Analyst, Critic, Expert) sometimes blur together with overlapping perspectives  
   5. Responses from agents are currently not meaningful.   
   6. Topic drift from practical next steps to theoretical discussions  
   7. “Don’t over abstract concepts. Focus on concrete, actionable guidance”  
   8. Over-emphasis on long-term strategy rather than immediate actionable items  
   9. Complex theoretical frameworks proposed before basic foundations are established  
   10. Excessive detail in responses that could be more concise  
   11. Director is summarizing rather than synthesizing key points  
   12. Make sure these agents aren’t primed to just agree with each other.   
2. Specialists being assigned and completing their tasks   
   1. Analyst may need to be adjusted to only analyze a certain subset of messages  
   2. They can identify areas that need further exploring based on their expertise?  
3. Conversation manager working at filtering out information to reduce token load on system/make sure only relevant data being stored  
4. A collaborative period begins (iteration manager class? Or just keep it all in qualitygate class)  
   1. Every iteration of this period is checked against validation metrics and/or quality gate?  
      1. Drift, consensus, questions answered, Active goals \+ conversation goals, satisfactory depth of understanding, actionable recommendations, maximum iteration limit  
      2. There needs to be a clear progression towards actionable conclusions   
      3. Redundant restatement of points across multiple exchanges   
      4. Need to track whether new complexities are being introduced vs resolving existing pains  
      5. If they are not met, continue through the collaboration period  
         1. At one point should parallel processing be considered?  
      6. Pattern/opportunity recognition of some kind  
   2. Does the director review the previous response and decide who is most useful to answer next? Or do I randomly select an agent?    
   3. Possible flow:  
      1. Iteration 1 → surface level comprehension, key question/problem identification, initial scope definition, basic direction for next steps  
      2. Iteration 2 → basic analysis from each relevant agent, identify areas needing deeper exploration, pattern/opportunity recognition  
      3. Iteration 3 → focus on most promising/critical aspects, challenge assumptions based on previous iterations, build on **validated** insights    
   4. If quality gate met, the director will synthesize responses and present the final output   
5. If there is another query, be mindful of what the context is that you maintain going forward  
   1. This could be the spot where we pull out only key points to carry forward into the next round of discussion.   
   2. Relevant history selection, priority information marking   
6. Speed \+ cost checks  
   1. Try to drop API costs. Explore alternative LLMs?  
   2. Look below at optimization strategies 

**Much later**

* 6 hats?  
* Look into feasibility of swapping over to socket for faster notifications to frontend   
* What data could be cached to reduce load on server/API   
* Look into session-based embedding storing/searching   
* Set up better logging system? See if it’s better to have a log per function/class? How to separate them to be more easily viewable/searchable.   
* Change over to a fetch call to the API to add in the AbortController functionality if a user wants to stop. Save API costs.

**Questions to consider:**

* How do we determine when to move to next iteration?  
* What triggers a deeper dive vs moving to conclusions?  
* How do we prevent circular discussions?  
* How do agent responsibilities shift in each iteration?  
* When should certain agents step back or become more prominent?  
* How do we maintain coherent progression between iterations?  
* What insights do we carry forward?  
* How do we prevent repetition while building depth?  
* How do we track the evolution of understanding?

**OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:**  
**Token Management**

* Track token usage  
* Optimize prompt lengths  
* Trim conversation history intelligently  
* Use smaller models for simpler tasks

**Batching Strategy**

* Combine related queries  
* Group validation checks  
* Batch similar tasks  
* Use parallel processing where beneficial

**Caching System**

* Cache common responses  
* Store validated information  
* Keep frequently used prompt templates  
* Maintain embedding cache

**Smart Routing**

* Use cheaper models when possible  
* Route simple tasks to rule-based systems  
* Only use expensive models for complex reasoning
