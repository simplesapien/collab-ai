Iterative Spiral Structure:

START -> User Query
↓
Iteration 1: Initial Understanding
- Surface-level comprehension
- Key question/problem identification 
- Initial scope definition
- basic direction for next steps
↓
Iteration 2: First Analysis Layer
- Basic analysis from each relevant agent
- Identify areas needing deeper exploration
- Pattern/opportunity recognition
↓
Iteration 3: Deeper Exploration
- Focus on most promising/critical aspects
- Challenge assumptions from previous iterations
- Build on validated insights
↓



Key Aspects to Consider:
Iteration Control
How do we determine when to move to next iteration?
What triggers a deeper dive vs moving to conclusions?
How do we prevent circular discussions?

Agent Role Evolution
How do agent responsibilities shift in each iteration?
When should certain agents step back or become more prominent?
How do we maintain coherent progression between iterations?

Knowledge Accumulation
What insights do we carry forward?
How do we prevent repetition while building depth?
How do we track the evolution of understanding?
