WORKING MEMORY INTEGRATION
Original Approach Problem: Could lead to redundant API calls to re-analyze or re-validate information

Cost-Efficient Approach:
Cache processed responses
Store derived insights
Maintain conversation embeddings for quick similarity checks
Keep track of already-validated information to avoid re-validation
Cut each context down to key points + questions when passing them around? 


VALIDATION SYSTEM
Original Approach Problem: Separate validation calls would multiply API costs

Cost-Efficient Approach:
Include validation requirements in the initial prompts
Use batched validation (multiple checks in one API call)
Implement local validation first (rule-based, consistency checks)
Only use API calls for critical validation points


KNOWLEDGE GATHERING
Original Approach Problem: Separate calls for gathering and analysis

Cost-Efficient Approach:
Combine gathering and initial analysis in the same prompt

Use structured prompts that force the LLM to:
Extract key information
Identify questions
Flag potential issues
All in one response




ITERATION CONTROL
Original Approach Problem: Each iteration could trigger multiple new API calls
Cost-Efficient Approach:


Set strict iteration limits
Implement "value assessment" before new API calls
Batch related questions/tasks
Cache and reuse similar responses


QUALITY GATES
Original Approach Problem: Additional API calls for quality checks
Cost-Efficient Approach:


Implement local quality checks first
Include quality criteria in main prompts
Use metadata from API responses (confidence scores, etc.)
Only use separate quality check calls for critical decisions

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:

Token Management


Track token usage
Optimize prompt lengths
Trim conversation history intelligently
Use smaller models for simpler tasks


Batching Strategy


Combine related queries
Group validation checks
Batch similar tasks
Use parallel processing where beneficial


Caching System


Cache common responses
Store validated information
Keep frequently used prompt templates
Maintain embedding cache


Smart Routing


Use cheaper models when possible
Route simple tasks to rule-based systems
Only use expensive models for complex reasoning
